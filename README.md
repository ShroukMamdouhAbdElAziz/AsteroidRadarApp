# AsteroidRadarApp

# is an app to view the asteroids detected by NASA that pass near Earth, 

 you can view all the detected asteroids given a period of time with data such as the size,
 
 velocity, distance to earth and if they are potentially hazardous.
 
 In this project, you will apply the skills such as fetching data from the internet, saving data to a database, and display the data in a clear, compelling UI.

You will need the NEoWs API which is a free, open source API provided by NASA JPL Asteroid team,“Is a RESTful web service for near earth Asteroid information. 

With NeoWs a user can: search for Asteroids based on their closest approach date to Earth, lookup a specific Asteroid with its NASA JPL small body id, as well as
browse the overall data-set.”

# The resulting output of the project will be two screens: 

a Main screen with a list of all the detected asteroids and

a Details screen that is going to display the data of that asteroid once it´s selected in the Main screen list. 

The main screen will also show the NASA image of the day to make the app more striking.

# Technologies Used

Kotlin language

MVVM ( Architecture Design pattern)

WorkManager to fetch the data from the internet .

Room ( to deal with the data when the mode is offline.

Retrofit to deal with the webService when the mode is online.

Navigation using Navgraph and safeArgs

ListAdapter and DiffUtil

ViewModel

LiveData

DataBinding

Accessability : 
The app works in talk back mode, it provides descriptions for all the texts and images
